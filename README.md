PROBLEM DEFINITION
The system aims to model and manage academic data for students, courses, instructors, and enrollments
The current challenge is inefficient data handling, redundancy, and inconsistency in manual or unstructured systems.
A relational database with an ER model provides structured storage, ensures consistency, reduces redundancy,
and supports efficient retrieval of student, course, and performance information.

Data Challenges

Data redundancy and inconsistency in student and course records.
Difficulty in tracking enrollments and performance efficiently.
Lack of structured relationships between students, courses, and instructors.

Expected Outcomes

Centralized database with well-defined relationships.
Reduced redundancy and improved data consistency.
Efficient storage, retrieval, and management of academic information.

Success Criteria

Database tables created without errors and enforce integrity constraints.
Queries execute correctly and return accurate results.
ER diagram fully represents the relationships among entities.
System supports easy updates, retrieval, and reporting of academic data. 


Result Analysis

The designed schema successfully stores and manages student, course, and enrollment data.
Queries validate relationships by retrieving accurate and consistent results.
The ER diagram confirms logical connections between entities, ensuring data integrity.
Overall, the database meets the intended academic management objectives.
